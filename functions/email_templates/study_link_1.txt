Hi there,

Thank you for picking up your equipment! Here is the link to your first study session: {{{ study_link }}}

This session will take around 30 minutes to complete. Please complete the session in a quiet environment, since you will need to record audio during the session. Because of this, you should also use a laptop or desktop computer (NOT a smartphone or tablet) to access the study. You can use Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge to access the experiment. Please do NOT use Safari or Internet Explorer.

In order to complete {{ total_sessions_text }} sessions before your drop-off appointment on {{{ dropoff_datetime_formatted }}}, we recommend starting your first session before {{{ latest_start_datetime_formatted_timefirst }}}.

If you have any questions, please let us know. Please remember to wear your Fitbit on nights between sessions.
